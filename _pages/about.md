Greetings! Here is Yìjùn Miào (缪亦隽, Ethan). I graduated from the SCNU, with a major in Electronic Information Engineering, and I currently pursuing a master's degree of Technology Management at UCSB. I have a genuine passion for both technology development and business management. I started my own tech studio, Etytech, during my university years, which focused on empowering the education industry through artificial intelligence and other development technologies. Now I'm committed to advancing my technical and managerial skills in a reputable technology company. Always open to connecting with professionals and exploring new opportunities.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me via the side bar or just click the "Contact" button and add me on WeChat.



Research Interests
======
I currently focus on Application and Gaming Development. My interests field are on the AR (Augmented Reality) and CV (Computer Vision). I firmly believe that as battery-based energy technology evolves, smartphones will not be the ultimate form of smart devices. Let’s wait and see what the next decade brings.
