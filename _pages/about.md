Greetings! Here is **Yìjùn Miào (缪亦隽, Ethan)** — a creator at the intersection of **technology, data, and product strategy**. I recently earned my Master’s degree in **Technology Management** from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and hold a Bachelor’s degree in **Electronic Information Engineering** from South China Normal University. I am also a polyglot (English, Mandarin, Cantonese), which make me confident when handling Cross-border communication

My journey spans from **embedded systems and circuit design**, to **data-driven product optimization** and **AI-powered web applications**. During undergrad, I founded **Etytech Studio**, where I led my team in building smart learning tools and interactive platforms for education. When I study my master's degree, I learn both "hard skills" (LLM, marketing, Data Analysis) and "soft skills" (Communication, Negotiation, Entrepreneurship). Now I’m committed to advancing my technical and managerial skills in a reputable technology company. Always open to connecting with professionals and exploring new opportunities.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me via the side bar or just click the “Contact” button and add me on WeChat.



Research Interests
======
I currently focus on **Application and Website** Development. My interests field are on the **AR (Augmented Reality) and CV (Computer Vision)**. I firmly believe that as battery-based energy technology evolves, smartphones will not be the ultimate form of smart devices. Let’s wait and see what the next decade brings.
